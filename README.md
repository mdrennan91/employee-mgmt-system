# Overview

This project is a simple console-based employee management system built in C#. My goal with this project was to get more comfortable with the C# language and understand how it handles basic things like classes, structs, file input/output, and working with lists.

I wanted to create something that felt like a real-world application — even if small — so I could practice adding, editing, and saving structured data. This app lets you manage employee records and stores the data between sessions using a local JSON file.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Git + GitHub for version control

The project is written entirely in C#. I also used the built-in `System.Text.Json` library for reading/writing JSON files.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- add validation for duplicate employee names or roles
- improve the menu UI (maybe color or spacing)
- allow sorting or filtering the employee list
- add support for saving multiple departments as a list
- maybe refactor into multiple files as it grows
